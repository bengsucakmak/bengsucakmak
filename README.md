## About Me

I am a senior-year Artificial Intelligence Engineering student with hands-on industry experience in LLM-based systems, agent architectures, and applied machine learning.

My work primarily focuses on:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- LangChain and LangGraph-based agent systems
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA / QLoRA)
- Data-driven system design and evaluation

My goal is to join a team that develops scalable and reliable AI solutions in real-world environments.

## Selected Projects

**LLM-based SQL Tool-Calling Agent (HAVELSAN)**  
Designed a LangGraph-based agent that converts natural language queries into secure, schema-aware SQL queries using RAG. Implemented automatic join-path discovery and a Streamlit-based visualization interface.

**Transformer-based Process Mining System**  
Developed an NLP system that extracts business processes from unstructured text and automatically generates BPMN/CPM diagrams, including bottleneck analysis and improvement suggestions.

**LLM Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking**  
Fine-tuned open-source LLMs using LoRA and QLoRA techniques and conducted comprehensive benchmarking across different GPU configurations, analyzing throughput, latency, and memory usage.

**Life Architect AI**  
Built a multi-agent personal assistant with task generation, mood tracking, reward mechanisms, productivity tools, and social integration modules.
